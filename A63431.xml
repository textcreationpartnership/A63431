         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

This work took up moſt part of that day, being the 9 of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> ſo that we had not day enough to fall upon the Iſland of the <hi>Vlie;</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Holmes</hi> being alſo informed by ſome Priſoners, that the place was not ſo conſiderable as it had been repreſented; and Night coming on, and perceiving two of our Fregats, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Dragon</hi> and <hi>Garlamd</hi> aground, it was thought moſt convenient for all hands firſt to go to work to get them off; Which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done, he continued in his intention of attempting the <hi>Vlie</hi> the next morning, as ſoon as the high Water would permit the motion of his Veſſels, but his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign was then likewiſe prevented; for ſo great a Guſt and Rain hapned that night, that the Arms and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition in the Boats, Hoys, and Ketches, having received much damage, he thought it beſt to weigh, and as the wind ſtood, to attempt ſomething upon the Iſland of <hi>Schelling,</hi> which the Morning proving moderate weather, he accordingly proſecuted, land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the help of his Long Boats, Eleven Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies on ſhore, where he diſcovered only ſome few ſcattering fellows, but met with little or no oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Leaving therefore one Company to ſecure his Boats, himſelf with Ten Companies marched up three miles to the Capital Town called <hi>Brandaris,</hi> a very fair Town or Dorp of above 1000 Houſes; where keeping five Companies upon the skirts of the Town to prevent any ſurpriſe of the Enemy, he ſent the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther five to fire and burn the Town; but finding them (as his vigilance was to ſecure a ſafe retreat) ſomewhat ſlow to execute that order, and fearing they might be tempted to forget themſelves in the pillage, he himſelf
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:55042:4"/>was forced to ſet fire to ſome Houſes on the windward, the ſooner to perfect the Work, and haſten his Men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; which burnt with that violence, that in half an hours time, the moſt part of the Town was in a flame. The Town was reported by thoſe that were found in it, to have been very rich, and ſo it appeared by ſome of the Soldiers Pockets; but very few people were to be ſeen in it, having had time to run away from the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, except ſome old Men and Women, who were uſed with all gentleneſs and humanity.</p>
            <p>The remaining Villages of that Iſland, which are two or three, had certainly run the ſame fortune, but conſidering it was near high Water, Sir <hi>Robert</hi> thought it not fit to loſe that opportunity of getting off to Sea, which he thought more conſiderable then to ſtay 24 hours for the deſtruction of them, remembring likewiſe that the channels between the <hi>Buoys</hi> were very narrow, and not bold without a frank wind. By high Water he got off all his men, and ſet ſail out of that place, retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill his firſt intentions of falling upon the <hi>Ulie;</hi> but as he was going on board, he received Orders from the Generals to return to the Fleet with all ſpeed, which accordingly he did that Evening, being the Tenth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> leaving behind him the marks of a ſingular conduct and moſt vigorous execution, and bringing off, beſides a conſiderable Booty to the private Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers and Seamen, the States Pleaſure-Boat of Twelve Guns, without other loſs then of ſix men killed, and about as many wounded.</p>
